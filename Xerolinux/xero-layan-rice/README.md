### Performance :

This rice has been throughly optimized for best performance on higher-end systems.. Although it might work on lower-end ones, for better performance I do not recommend that you use it there. So please do not report any performance issues.

### Installation

**Install At Own Risk!!!**. As of now it supports **Plasma 6.x.x**. If you notice any issues and report them via issue tracker on here and I will do my best to address them. To apply the rice, please follow the commands posted below. You will need either **Paru** or **Yay** (installed via my toolkit). Keep in mind that this will replace some files. Read below...

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/xerolinux/xero-layan-git
cd xero-layan-git/ && ./install.sh
```

### Your Settings

The install script will backup some app settings & all system ones before applying and overriding them with new ones, you will be able to restore what you need from the backup.

## Script will do the following steps :

- Create a backup of your ~/.config folder.
- Download and install necessary packages if needed...
- Override your settings and files with this rice's.
- Install and apply New Grub Theme...
